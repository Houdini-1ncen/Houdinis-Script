# Houdinis Script

**This is a lua script for the GTA 5 Mod-menu "Midnight" which requires BoolyScript to run**

**Following assets have been used in the making of this script:** 

GTA5 natives: https://alloc8or.re/gta5/nativedb/

GTA5 statlist: https://gist.github.com/1337Nexo/945fe9724b9dd20d33e7afeabd2746dc

Midnight lua api: https://midnight-docs.vercel.app/gta/lua/classes/pointer

## Inspiration:
**What started off as a personal issue of myself with a borken feature is what lead to all of this, I could've never imagined taht this script would reach such dimensios**

**It all started with a script for just myself, but i quickly came to realize that many people were experiencing the same issues as I so i began to publish my little script which only consisted of a nightclub loop and some other small features. I began to expand the script slowly but surely, my focus was on recovery options hence the previous name: Houdinis Magic Recovery, ik pretty edgy but i liked it at that time. As the Script got bigger I changed the name and added alot more variety and expanded into other fields of GTA5 modding, I added teleportation options, new recovery methods, a miscellaneous tab, unlock options, various different lobby but mainly chat focused features and a vehicle tab. I was soon running out of ideas so i shifted my focus towards optimization and debugging. So there won't be updates as frequent as they used to be, but I am still developing and maintaining this script.
